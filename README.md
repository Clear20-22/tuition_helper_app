## 🏛️ Architecture Patterns

### Clean Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Dependency Inversion**: Higher layers depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Testability**: Easy to unit test individual components

### MVVM Pattern with Provider
- **Model**: Data models and business entities
- **View**: Flutter widgets and screens
- **ViewModel**: Provider classes managing state and business logic

### Repository Pattern
- Services act as repositories for data access
- Abstract data sources (local storage, remote APIs)
- Consistent interface for data operations

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
UI (Screens) ↔ State Management (Providers) ↔ Business Logic (Services) ↔ Data (Models)
     ↓                    ↓                         ↓                       ↓
  User Input         State Updates           Service Calls           Storage Operations
```

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with UI screens
2. **State Update**: Providers update application state
3. **Service Call**: Services handle business logic and data operations
4. **Data Persistence**: Models are saved to local storage/database
5. **UI Refresh**: Providers notify listeners to update UI

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📱 Responsive Design
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Adaptive Layouts**: Different UI layouts for different screen sizes
- **Responsive Components**: All UI elements scale appropriately
- **Device-Specific Navigation**: Enhanced navigation for larger screens
- **Font Scaling**: Supports system accessibility preferences

### Offline-First Architecture
- Local SQLite database for primary storage
- Hive for fast key-value caching
- Background sync when online
- Graceful offline operation

### State Management
- Provider pattern for reactive UI
- Centralized state management
- Efficient rebuild optimization
- Error state handling

### Modular Design
- Feature-based organization
- Reusable components
- Easy to extend and maintain
- Clear separation of concerns

### Cross-Platform Support
- Single codebase for Android, iOS, and Web
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Responsive design patterns
- Native platform integrations

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### Adding New Features
1. Create data model in `models/`
2. Add business logic to appropriate service in `services/`
3. Create provider for state management in `providers/`
4. Build UI screens in `screens/`
5. Add navigation routes in `routes/`
6. Create reusable widgets in `widgets/`

### Code Organization
- Keep related files in the same directory
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Follow Dart naming conventions
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Write unit tests for business logic

### State Management Best Practices
- Use Provider for app-wide state
- Keep UI state local when possible
- Implement proper error handling
- Show loading states during operations
- Optimize rebuild performance

## 📚 Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **flutter**: UI framework
- **provider**: State management
- **hive & hive_flutter**: Fast local storage
- **sqflite**: SQLite database
- **shared_preferences**: Simple key-value storage

### Feature Dependencies
- **firebase_core & firebase_messaging**: Push notifications
- **geolocator & geocoding**: Location services
- **flutter_local_notifications**: Local notifications
- **table_calendar**: Calendar widgets
- **fl_chart**: Data visualization
- **file_picker**: File operations

### Development Dependencies
- **build_runner**: Code generation
- **hive_generator**: Hive adapter generation
- **flutter_lints**: Code quality
- **mockito**: Testing utilities

## 🔧 Build & Run

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.8.1+
- Dart 3.0+
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Platform-specific SDKs (Android/iOS/Web)

### Commands
```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate code (Hive adapters)
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Run on different platforms
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
flutter run -d chrome
flutter run -d macos
```

### Known Issues & Solutions

#### Firebase Configuration
The app gracefully handles missing Firebase configuration files:
- `google-services.json` (Android)
- `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS)

If Firebase features are not needed, the app will continue to work with local notifications and storage only.

#### Android Build Issues
If you encounter core library desugaring errors:
1. The app already includes desugaring configuration
2. Clean and rebuild: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
3. For Android API level issues, check `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
